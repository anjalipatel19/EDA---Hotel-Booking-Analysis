## Project Summary

The hospitality industry is dynamic and affected by numerous factors including seasonality, guest type, lead time, and distribution channels. By analyzing a rich dataset of hotel bookings, this project aims to:

- Understand customer behavior and preferences.
- Identify peak booking periods and cancellation patterns.
- Evaluate the impact of booking methods and room types.
- Help hotels better manage resources and forecast demand.

This analysis is crucial in a post-pandemic world where data-driven decisions are vital to staying competitive.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **Plotly** – for interactive charts


## Key Findings

- City hotels have higher cancellation rates than resort hotels.
- Most bookings are made via online travel agents.
- July and August show peak booking activity.
- Longer lead time tends to increase the cancellation probability.
- Repeat guests are significantly less likely to cancel.
